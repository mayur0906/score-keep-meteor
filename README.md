# Score Keeper Application

An application created while learning the fundamentals of the MeteorJS web application framework.

This application uses ReactJS and SCSS styling for it's front-end, NodeJS for the server in the
back-end, with MongoDB as the NoSQL databased used to store player data.

The client side JavaScript code uses JSX with the ES6 standard for efficient function calling and code injections throughout the program.

The application was written with the BEM naming convention to label various components in the web application.
